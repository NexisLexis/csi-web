            <h2>Website</h2>
            <ul>This website is an open-source project for the Christian School International. This website is composed by students who are currently in grade 9 (3rd year highschool) and had fun contributing to this project.
            </ul><br>
            <h2>CSI Vision</h2>
            <ul>
            Christian School International is a Christ-Centered School devoted to the development of the whole person with a scientific and Christian world view.
            </ul><br>
            <h2>CSI Mission</h2>
            <ul>
            Christian School International provides:<br>
            <li>Educational opportunities of learning to know, learning to do, learning to live together with others and learning to be the of kind that God has Created- to become fruitful Christians and productive members of the society;</li> <br>
            <li>Opportunities to work with parents in fulfilling the God-given responsibility of developing the creativity of their children; their unique talents and ther latent responsibilities;</li> <br>
            <li>Opportunities to learn and develop responsible stewardship of their God-given potentials inherent in them: mental, social, emotional and spiritual.</li>
            </ul> <br>
            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <ul>
            Children are gifts from God (Psalm 127:3-5). They are precious jewels that give parents joy and fulfilment in life. In turn, parenthood is a God-given privilege and a responsible stweardship in providing each child with education and a well-rounded personality. <br><br>

            Christian School International believes that education being provided for its students shall be dong in partnership with parents with the basic aim of teaching childrrn to grow as responsible individuals through the application of Christian values in the curriculum. <br><br>

            Christian Education at Csi is a strategic approach to the human resource development, which should result in the development of the child's intellectual capacity (IQ), improve his emotional quotient (QE) as well as technological quotient (TQ) and ability to cope with a rapidly changing society. <br><br>

            The English language will be emphasized as a strategy of CSI for the student's higher achievement in Science, in Math and in various spheres of oreparation for business and the professions.</ul><br>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Provide the highest possible quality basic Christian Education for a scientific, technologixal and gloval economic environment;</li><br>
            <li>Offer students teaching-learning opportunities that lead to growth in quality life through spiritual, moral, intellectual, emotional and aesthetic development;</li><br>
            <li>Give opportunities for citizenship for each student to become an effective leader and participant in his/her family, community and their society.</li>
